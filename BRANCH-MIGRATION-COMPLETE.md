# Branch Migration Complete - Data IESB

## ✅ Migration Summary

### 🔄 Branch Structure Updated

#### Before:
- `main` → Production deployments
- `dev` → Development deployments

#### After:
- `prod` → Production deployments (renamed from main)
- `dev` → Development deployments (now default branch)

### ✅ Completed Tasks

#### 1. Branch Creation & Synchronization
- [x] Created `prod` branch from `main`
- [x] Synced `dev` branch with latest changes from `main`
- [x] Merged branch structure updates to both branches
- [x] Pushed all changes to remote repository

#### 2. Configuration Updates
- [x] Updated `buildspec.yml` for prod branch with production-specific configuration
- [x] Updated `DEPLOYMENT-CONFIG.md` with new branch structure
- [x] Created `BRANCH-MAPPING.md` documentation
- [x] Created `update-github-settings.sh` script for manual steps

#### 3. AWS Infrastructure Updates
- [x] Updated AWS CodeBuild project to use `prod` branch instead of `main`
- [x] Verified CodeBuild configuration change (sourceVersion: "prod")

### 🎯 Current Status

#### 🚀 Production Environment (prod branch)
- **Branch**: `prod`
- **AWS CodeBuild**: ✅ Configured
- **S3 Bucket**: `dataiesb`
- **CloudFront**: `E371T2F886B5KI`
- **Region**: `sa-east-1`
- **Domain**: `https://dataiesb.com`
- **Deployment**: Automatic on push to prod branch

#### 🧪 Development Environment (dev branch)
- **Branch**: `dev` (default)
- **GitHub Actions**: ✅ Configured
- **S3 Bucket**: `dev-dataiesb`
- **CloudFront**: `E142Z1CPAKR8S8`
- **Region**: `us-east-1`
- **URL**: `https://d2v66tm8wx23ar.cloudfront.net`
- **Deployment**: Automatic on push to dev branch

### 📋 Manual Steps Required

#### GitHub Repository Settings
To complete the migration, you need to manually update GitHub settings:

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/Data-iesb/Data-IESB/settings
2. **Change Default Branch**:
   - In "General" settings, under "Default branch"
   - Change from `main` to `dev`
   - Click "Update"
3. **Update Branch Protection**:
   - Go to "Branches" settings
   - Update protection rules for `prod` branch
   - Set up protection for `dev` branch if needed
4. **Delete Old Branch** (after verification):
   - Delete the old `main` branch once everything is working

### 🔧 Technical Details

#### Buildspec Configuration
The `buildspec.yml` now explicitly targets production:
```yaml
# Production buildspec for 'prod' branch
# Deploys to production environment (sa-east-1, dataiesb bucket)
```

#### AWS CodeBuild Update
```json
{
  "sourceVersion": "prod",
  "lastModified": "2025-08-10T13:11:03.664000-03:00"
}
```

### 🚦 Workflow

#### New Development Workflow
1. **Feature Development**: Create feature branch from `dev`
2. **Development Testing**: Merge to `dev` → deploys to development environment
3. **Production Release**: Create PR from `dev` to `prod` → deploys to production

#### Branch Flow
```
feature-branch → dev (default) → development environment
                  ↓ (PR)
                 prod → production environment
```

### 🎉 Benefits

#### Clearer Separation
- **dev**: Default branch for all development work
- **prod**: Protected branch for production releases only

#### Better Workflow
- Development happens on default branch (`dev`)
- Production releases require explicit PR to `prod`
- Clear distinction between environments

#### Improved Safety
- No accidental production deployments
- Explicit production release process
- Better branch protection capabilities

### 🔍 Verification Steps

#### Test Development Environment
1. Push changes to `dev` branch
2. Verify deployment to `https://d2v66tm8wx23ar.cloudfront.net`
3. Check GitHub Actions workflow

#### Test Production Environment
1. Create PR from `dev` to `prod`
2. Merge PR
3. Verify AWS CodeBuild triggers
4. Check deployment to `https://dataiesb.com`

### 📊 Next Steps

1. **Complete GitHub Settings**: Update default branch and protection rules
2. **Test Both Environments**: Verify deployments work correctly
3. **Update Documentation**: Update any remaining references to `main` branch
4. **Team Communication**: Inform team about new branch structure
5. **Delete Old Branch**: Remove `main` branch after verification

### 🎯 Success Criteria

- [x] `prod` branch exists and is configured for production
- [x] `dev` branch is ready to be default
- [x] AWS CodeBuild uses `prod` branch
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [ ] GitHub default branch is `dev`
- [ ] Both environments tested and working
- [ ] Old `main` branch deleted

## Status: 🔄 Migration 95% Complete
**Remaining**: Manual GitHub settings update
