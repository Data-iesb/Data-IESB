## üéØ Verification Steps

After completing the manual steps:

### 1. Test Default Branch
```bash
# Clone fresh repository
git clone https://github.com/Data-iesb/Data-IESB.git test-clone
cd test-clone
git branch
# Should show: * dev (not main)
```

### 2. Test Branch Protection
- Try to push directly to `dev` ‚Üí Should be blocked
- Try to push directly to `main` ‚Üí Should be blocked
- Create PR to `dev` ‚Üí Should require 1 approval
- Create PR to `main` ‚Üí Should require 2 approvals

### 3. Test Auto-Deployment
```bash
# Make a small change on dev branch
echo "<!-- Test change -->" >> src/index.html
git add .
git commit -m "test: verify auto-deployment"
git push origin dev
```
- Check GitHub Actions tab
- Verify deployment to: https://d2v66tm8wx23ar.cloudfront.net

**üö® Important: Repository Workflow Change**

We've updated our development workflow for better collaboration and production safety:

**New Default Branch**: `dev` (was `main`)
- New contributors automatically get the safe development branch
- All new features should be developed on `dev` first
- Production (`main`) is now protected

**For Existing Contributors**:
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
```

**New Workflow**:
1. Create feature branch from `dev`
2. Submit PR to `dev` (auto-deploys to development)
3. After testing, promote to `main` (production)

**Development URL**: https://d2v66tm8wx23ar.cloudfront.net
**Production URL**: https://dataiesb.com

Questions? Check the updated README.md or ask Roberto.

## üîÑ Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If something goes wrong, you can quickly rollback:

1. Change default branch back to `main`
2. Remove branch protection rules
3. Revert the last commit on `dev`

## üìû Support

If you need help with any of these steps:
- Check the documentation in the repository
- Contact Roberto (DevOps lead)
- Create an issue using the new templates

**Status**: ‚è≥ Waiting for manual GitHub configuration
